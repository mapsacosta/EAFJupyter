Multiple sessions
*********

We have enabled a feature in JupyterHub that allows our users to have up to 5 named sessions in parallel. If you have many projects or need to use separate environments, JupyterHub will keep track of your notebooks in the home page.

Instructions
================
* Click on the 'Home' button at the right hand, top menu. You will see a webpage with a list of Named Servers. 
* To add a new server/notebook, enter a DNS-safe name into the textbox 'Name your server'
* Click on the 'Add new server' hyperlink on the right to the textbox. Jupyter will present server options and will spawn a notebook. 
* To come back to your notebook list, head back to the home page, where the list of servers will display all active notebooks. 
* The table display will show a clickable URL link for easy access to any of your active notebooks.
