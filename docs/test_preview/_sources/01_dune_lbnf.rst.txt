LBNF DUNE/ProtoDUNE
=====================

There are several types of notebooks available to a DUNE user. You can choose between CPU and GPU notbooks. If you are unsure what notebook to use, see the :doc:`Choosing a Notebook <01_choosing_a_notebook>` page. Each notebook inherits packages from a base notebook, the base notebook will be listed with each image along with the link to it's packages. To see all the OS base images, you can look at the :doc:`Base Images page <01_baseimages>`. Some notebooks also inherit from the other CPU Interactive notebooks, these will be listed as well. 

To learn what packages are in each notebook, select a notebook below:

* `CPU Interactives <cpu notebooks dune>`
   * `AL9 <al9 dune>`
   * `SL7 <sl7 dune>`
* `NVIDIA® A100 GPU <gpu notebooks dune>`
   * `AL9 - 10GB/20GB/40GB GPU slot <al9 10/20/40 gb dune>`
   * `SL7 - 10GB/20GB/40GB GPU slot <sl7 10/20/40 gb dune>`
