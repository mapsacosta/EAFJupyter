Visual Studio Code
******************

Jupyterhub has good support for using VS Code.

See `this Jupyter blog post <https://blog.jupyter.org/connect-to-a-jupyterhub-from-visual-studio-code-ed7ed3a31bcb>`_ for more details.
You will need to be on-site or using VPN: it does not work through a proxy.

Additionally, you can follow the same directions to use JetBrains DataSpell with some minor changes.
You should first start a server with the "Start My Server" option: the named
server options do *not* work with DataSpell.

You may have to click the "Trusted" box in DataSpell; otherwise it may start an unsupported debugging mode.
