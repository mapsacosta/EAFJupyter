Getting started
****************

Each experiment has different notebook options when starting a server and are grouped into the following: CMS, LBNF DUNE/ProtoDUNE, FIFE, Astro/Cosmic Frontier, ACCEL-AI, ACORN, and Fermilab. In general, only the notebooks where the user has an associated experiment should be available when selecting which to open. Users also have access to the Fermilab notebooks. 

To get started, select your experiment group:

- :doc:`CMS <01_cmslpc>`- CMS, LHC
- :doc:`Astro/Cosmic Frontier <01_cosmic>` - LSST, MAGIS-100, DES, DarkSide, Holometer, CDMS, COUPP, Pierre Auger Observatory, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, GammeV
- :doc:`ACCEL-AI <01_accelerator>` -  PIP-II, Test Beam Facility, ILC, LHC Accelerator Program, Muon Collider
- :doc:`ACORN <01_acorn>` -  PIP-II, Test Beam Facility, ILC, LHC Accelerator Program, Muon Collider
- :doc:`FIFE <01_fife>` - LArIAT, NOvA, MicroBooNE, MINERvA, ICARUS, SBND, Mu2e, Muon g-2
- :doc:`LBNF DUNE/ProtoDUNE <01_dune_lbnf>` - DUNE, LBNF
- :doc:`Fermilab <01_fermi_gen>` - Everyone
