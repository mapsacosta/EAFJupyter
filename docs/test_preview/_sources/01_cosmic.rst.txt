Astro/Cosmic Frontier
=======================

There are several types of notebooks available to an astro user. You can choose between CPU and GPU notbooks and generic and lsst notebooks. If you are unsure what notebook to use, see the :doc:`Choosing a Notebook <01_choosing_a_notebook>` page. Each notebook inherits packages from a base notebook, the base notebook will be listed with each image along with the link to it's packages. To see all the OS base images, you can look at the :doc:`Base Images page <01_baseimages>`. Some notebooks also inherit from the other CPU Interactive notebooks, these will be listed as well. 

To learn what packages are in each notebook, select a notebook below:

* `CPU Interactives <cpu notebooks cosmic>`
   * `AL9 <al9 cosmic>`
   * `AL9 (LSST kernel) <al9 lsst cosmic>`
   * `SL7 <sl7 cosmic>`
   * `SL7 (LSST kernel) <sl7 lsst cosmic>`
* `NVIDIA® A100 GPU <gpu notebooks cosmic>`
   * `AL9 (10GB/20GB/40GB GPU slot) <al9 10/20/40 gb cosmic>`
   * `SL7 (10GB/20GB/40GB GPU slot) <sl7 10/20/40 gb cosmic>`
