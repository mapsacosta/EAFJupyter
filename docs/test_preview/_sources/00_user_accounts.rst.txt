EAF Access and Accounts
*********

General Usage
==============

CMS USERS/VISITORS PLEASE GO TO `CMS ACCOUNTS <https://eafjupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/00_user_accounts.html#cms-accounts>`_


The EAF requires users to have a Fermilab services account which can be obtained in different ways depending on your
affiliation with Fermilab. The links to instructions are provided for users and visitors looking to obtain a general
Fermilab account.

If you are offsite, you will also need to either use a proxy or VPN.

   * `Fermilab Proxy with FoxyProxy (no RSA token/Yubikey required) <https://library.fnal.gov/off-site-electronic-access-instructions#foxy>`_
   * `Fermilab VPN (RSA token/Yubikey required) <https://fermi.servicenowservices.com/wp/?id=evg-kb-article&sys_id=567a699a1b73f0104726a8efe54bcbe3>`_

CMS Accounts
================

Obtaining accounts as a CMS affiliate is slightly different than obtaining a general Fermilab account since there are also CERN accounts to obtain. The link for the instructions is provided and guides through all the steps needed to have full access as a CMS memeber. The link provided has instructions for obtaining Fermilab and CMS LPC computing accounts, getting a badge for onsite access, getting CERN accounts, getting a personal grid certificate, and how to connect to the LPC. 

IMPORTANT: It can take 4-6 weeks for accounts to be approved.
